Surreal Docs is the first all-encompassing docs generation system for Unreal Engine-powered projects. It generates documentation for Unreal Engine projects, C++ and Blueprint API references in particular. It enables users to create their own custom pages using a feature-rich dialect of Markdown. Surreal Docs seamlessly integrates with our online docs hosting - Surreal Cloud, making it easy to share the docs publicly, privately with a team or within an organization. Finally, Surreal Docs perfectly understands all UE-specific C++ features, Blueprints and easily interweaves corresponding C++ and Blueprint entities in the resulting documentation! 

**This repository contains Surreal Docs UE - a part of Surreal Docs project developed by [Medelfor](https://medelfor.com "Medelfor"). Please refer to the [main repository](https://github.com/medelfor/surreal-docs "Main Surreal Docs repository") for more info on the project.**

## Unreal Engine Compatibilty
